1. With Next.js, creating folders inside the main app folder automatically sets up a route with that structure.
   i.e., if we create a TicketApp folder, http://localhost:3000/TicketPage will be a valid URL for our application
   a) creating a folder with square brackets - i.e. [id] - will treat that folder name as a param.
   The param can then be accessed by the .jsx files inside that folder
   b) creating a folder with curved brackets - i.e. (components) - will make it so that the folder is not treated as a route.

2. Tailwind
   a) In the tailwind.config.js file, we can create css defaults for our application (need to dig into that).
   b) The globals.css file is set up with @base, @components and @utilities. Things can overwrite other properties depending on which one we're using.
